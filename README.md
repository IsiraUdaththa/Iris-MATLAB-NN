# Neural Network Classification in MATLAB: Iris Flowers and Disease Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for implementing neural network classification on two distinct datasets: Iris Flowers and Disease Prediction.

### Iris Flowers
The Iris Flowers dataset involves the classification of iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The neural network is trained on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Disease Prediction
The Disease Prediction dataset focuses on predicting the likelihood of a disease based on various health parameters. The neural network is trained on features relevant to health diagnostics.
